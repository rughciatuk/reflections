When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I whould want to use remote when i want my work to be back up
and when i need to collabrit with other pepole.




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Beaucse if another person made a change you don't want
ot if he and you made chages to the same thing its will
create a conflict.




Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

The diff is that forks is working only in git and its take one
repos adn copy it's to your collaction of repos.
Clones take an exciting repos and "copy" it to a new location
it can be from GitHub or from your on computer.
branches are new "direction" for the repos.
I will use fork when I want to use someone else repos and add to it.
I will use clones when I have somthing in other location and i want
to copy it.
I will use branches when I want to implument somthing that should 
not be in the main version. 




What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can see what is the diff between you commit and the last thing 
that you pull
