When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I whould want to use remote when i want my work to be back up
and when i need to collabrit with other pepole.




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Beaucse if another person made a change you don't want
ot if he and you made chages to the same thing its will
create a conflict.
